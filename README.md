Real-time AI/ML-based system for detecting and recognizing multiple faces using computer vision .

# Multiperson Facial Recognition System
This Multiperson Facial Recognition System is a real-time AI/ML-powered solution designed to detect and identify multiple individuals simultaneously through live video feeds. It leverages deep learning and computer vision to ensure fast, accurate face detection, recognition, and logging. Ideal for security and surveillance applications, the system supports modular updates, seamless camera integration, and scalable recognition performance.

üöÄ Features

- üîç Real-time face detection and recognition
- üë• Supports multiple people simultaneously
- üéØ High-accuracy recognition using deep learning models
- üì∑ Webcam/CCTV camera integration
- üß† Modular architecture with training and inference pipeline
- üìà Logs and stores recognition results for analysis

üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib / face_recognition
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Flask (for web-based interface)
- SQLite / Firebase (for optional storage)

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash-
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiperson-facial-recognition.git
cd multiperson-facial-recognition
````

2. Install dependencies:

bash-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

bash-
python app.py
```
üì∏ How It Works

1. Capture and label face images.
2. Train a facial recognition model using embeddings.
3. Use webcam/CCTV feed for real-time detection.
4. Match detected faces with the trained data.
5. Display recognition results on screen or web UI.

üìà Future Enhancements

* üö™ Access control system integration
* üß™ Improved accuracy with face embeddings (FaceNet)
* üåê Cloud-based storage and dashboard
* üì± Mobile version for live surveillance
